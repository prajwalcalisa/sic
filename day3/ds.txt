data structure:
storing and arranging data in memory in some particular way so as to achieve some efficiency
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
array:
where elements are stored in continuous memory locations
memory inefficient-size is fixed
time efficient-access any element in 1 unit time
simplest ds and easy to use with the help of subscript
note:ds to which we can apply subscript is called as ordered ds.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
arithmetic operators:
+,-,*,/,%,^,//,**

I/P are numbers
O/P are numbers
All are binary operators
Used with infix operation

All operators except ** has left to right associativity
